## Sailboat Checklist
Bring together teams and stakeholders to gain a shared understanding of their goals, drivers and barriers. Find out what is slowing you down, or if the purpose or goals are not quite right.

> This tactic requires you to **Theme Sort** as you go. Follow up this session by framing your barriers with **How Might We...**

Instructions

- [ ] On a shared workspace, draw a boat out at sea – this boat represents the team or the project.
- [ ] Draw an island – this represents the goal. Ask the group to write down what they believe the team or project’s goals are, one per sticky note.
- [ ] Ask each person to share what they’ve written, and **Theme Sort** them near the island.
- [ ] If you haven’t already, draw a sail on the boat. Explain that this represents what’s driving you towards your goal. Ask the group to write down these drivers.
- [ ] Share and **Theme Sort** them near the boat.
- [ ] Draw an anchor coming from the boat. Explain this represents the barriers to reaching your goal. Ask the group to write down what’s slowing or stopping your progress.
- [ ] Share and **Theme Sort** them near the anchor.
- [ ] **Secret Vote** on the goals to understand what everyone believes is most important to work towards.
- [ ] Finally, **Secret Vote** on the barriers to understand what the most important problem to solve is.
