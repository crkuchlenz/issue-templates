## Sticky Steps

With a clear step-by-step plan, you can turn seemingly unachievable or difficult goals into tangible realities.

> Start with a clear goal from **Sailboat** or **Newspaper Headline**. Afterwards, use **Who, What, When** to create an action plan.

- [ ] Write the goal on the far right of your workspace. The goal is your desired end-state.
- [ ] Ask the following question to the group: “What would have to happen just before this for us to succeed?”
- [ ] Put the answer on a sticky note to the left of the goal.
- [ ] Ask the same question again for the sticky note you’ve just placed: “What would have to happen just before this for us to succeed?”
- [ ] Repeat this process until you have stepped all the way back to today.
- [ ] Plan how you will start on the first thing you need to do (i.e., your left-most sticky note).

>Tip: as you step backwards through your plan, you might find certain steps that need to happen simultaneously. This may cause your plan to split and branch out to two paths running side by side.

>This is fine, but at all times try to consider if each step is absolutely necessary for achieving the desired end-state. The more linear your path, the easier it will be to achieve your goal.
