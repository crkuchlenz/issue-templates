## G.R.O.W.

Set a goal in the context of where you are now, which obstacles you face, and what tangible things you can actually do to achieve it.

> Start with a clear goal from Sailboat or Newspaper Headline. Follow with Who, What, When to create an action plan.
Instructions

- [ ]    Draw a table with four columns on a shared workspace and use Goal, Reality, Options and Will as headings.
- [ ]    Ask everyone to privately write down suggestions for goals, one per sticky note., then share them, Theme Sort and Secret Vote on the favourite. Write this in Goal.
    - Is this goal targeting a specific area? How will we measure progress towards this goal? Is the goal assignable (who is going to do it)? Is it realistic with the resources we have? Is the goal time-limited? When do we want to see results?
    - Do the same for Reality by asking everyone the following:
    - What is our starting point? What is happening now (what, who, when and how often)? What is the effect or result of this? Have we already taken any steps towards the goal? Does this goal conflict with any other goals or objectives that we have?
- [ ]    Explore the Options (use Idea Eight to generate lots of ideas, quickly). Ask:
    - What else could we do? What if certain constraints were removed? Would that change things? What are the advantages/ disadvantages of each option? Which factors or considerations will we use to weigh the options? What do we need to stop doing to achieve this goal? Which obstacles stand in our way?
- [ ]    Establish what you Will do by committing to some of the Options. (Who, What, When can help you clarify.)
