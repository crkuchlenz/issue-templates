## Objectives & Key Results

The problem with most goals is that distractions get in the way of achieving them. The OKR framework is designed to give you ‘radical focus’ on achieving an objective. It can be used personally, within a team, or at an organisational level.

Instructions:

- [ ] Before the meeting, invite everyone to submit their top objective for the team to achieve in the next quarter. An objective is a qualitative and aspirational ‘end state’. For example: launch the best possible version of Workshop Tactics beta.
- [ ] Put each objective on a sticky note, share them and then **Theme Sort**.
- [ ] Debate and use **Secret Vote** to determine your primary objective. Having more than one objective defeats the purpose of ‘radical focus’.
- [ ] List as many progress metrics as you can in 10 minutes. They should show you’re closer to achieving the objective. For example: `number of pre-orders, proof-reading rounds, positive feedback received`.
- [ ] Use **Theme Sort** and **Secret Vote** to group and decide on three metrics.
- [ ] Turn your three metrics into Key Results by setting specific, quantitative targets. For example: get x pre-orders a month, proof-read by x different people.
- [ ] Agree on specific numbers for each Key Result. You should feel like you have a fifty-fifty chance of achieving each one in the next quarter. For example: get 40 pre-orders a month.
